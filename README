* Description
Andrea studied computer science in Italy and in Germany, and currently
works in London on a Python infrastructure codeabase. He has been
working in Python for 7 years now, and enjoyed the wonderful community
in various Python conferences.

He is a passionate Linux user and fascinated by functional
programming, and enjoys dancing and doing sports when away from the
computer.

* Decorators and context managers

  Interesting decorators to see

** TODO check [[http://blogs.onresolve.com/?p%3D48][this slide presentation on decorators]]

** Caching

** Retry_on_error

** Partial function application

** Section

** Property

** Using __call__ and the def

** Nasty use of the internal function modifying the code

* Context managers

  Very simple to implement your own context manager, simply create a
  class with __enter__ and __exit__ or use yield and @contextlib
  
  This talk will introduce decorators
  (http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators) and context managers
  (http://docs.python.org/library/contextlib.html) and show a few
  possible use cases with real code.

  We will for example have a look at decorators that add a transparent
  cache, retry on failures automatically, and add a property to a class.

  Then we will introduce context managers and the *with* statement,
  and show how it can make our life easier.

* ZeroMQ from scratch
  This talk will be a very brief introduction to ZeroMQ and then jump
  straight in showing an example of how we can create with just a few
  lines of Python a full distributed program.


** TODO should add what is the application actually doing or not?
  
# Local Variables:
# mode: org
# End:

* General presentation important things
  - speak slowly and clearly
  - if doing something interactive, show things very slowly
  - avoid too much typing, only final visualisation
