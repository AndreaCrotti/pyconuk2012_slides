* Decorators and context managers

  Interesting decorators to see

** Caching

** Retry_on_error

** Partial function application

** Section

** Property

** Using __call__ and the def

** Nasty use of the internal function modifying the code

* Context managers

  Very simple to implement your own context manager, simply create a
  class with __enter__ and __exit__ or use yield and @contextlib
   

* ZeroMQ from scratch
  This talk will be a very brief introduction to ZeroMQ and then jump
  straight in showing an example of how we can create with just a few
  lines of Python a full distributed program.


** TODO should add what is the application actually doing or not?
