 ZeroMQ from scratch
=====================

.. motivation: we want to be able to exploit parallelism, using
.. message-passing instead of threads Not an expert but saw a couple

*It's like two drunkards trying to share a beer. It doesn't matter if they're good buddies. Sooner or later they're going to get into a fight. And the more drunkards you add to the pavement, the more they fight each other over the beer. The tragic majority of MT applications look like drunken bar fights.*
