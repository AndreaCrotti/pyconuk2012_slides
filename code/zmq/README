A possible idea for the subscriber might be:

- area_manager split a picture in many small pieces
- sends every of the pieces to the workers, that will do something with it
- the picture is sent back modified and merged together in a web interface,
  which was listening on the same socket


Use flask for the web server, zeromq and maybe the PIL to split and
reprocess the image back together.
