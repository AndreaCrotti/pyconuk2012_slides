A possible idea for the subscriber might be:

- area_manager split a picture in many small pieces
- sends every of the pieces to the workers, that will do something with it
- the picture is sent back modified and merged together in a web interface,
  which was listening on the same socket


Use flask for the web server, zeromq and maybe the PIL to split and
reprocess the image back together.

How it could work:
- splitter splits the original picture in many pictures
- manager keep sending to a socket the content of a directory, with the format
  (width, length, row, column, image_dumped)
- a website shows the images received and blanks the empty spots accordingly until it's filled
